                <p>Linux is an open source OS used in various systems such as ATM machines, smartphones, servers, and supercomputers.
                     It is known for its extreme stability, security, and flexibility.</p>
                
                <p>Linux offers a wide range of distributions (distros) such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS, each catering to different user 
                    needs and preferences.</p>
                
                <p>It is widely used in server environments due to its robustness and cost-effectiveness. Linux also provides a powerful command-line
                     interface, making it a favorite among developers and system administrators. A huge benefit of Linux is that unless a kernel change 
                    is detected, it doesn't require a full system reboot. This allows for greater uptime and reliability in business critical systems.</p>
                
                <p>Additionally, Linux has strong community support and a vast repository of open-source software, making it a versatile choice 
                    for various computing needs.</p>
