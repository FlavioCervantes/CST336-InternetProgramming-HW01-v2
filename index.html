                Greetings, hope all is well! <br />
<p> In this website I will be discussing various computer science related technologies such as  PowerShell scripting, monitoring software known as DynaTrace, Solarwinds.
 Operating Systems like Linux.
 Each section will provide insights into the features, benefits, and use cases of these technologies. 
 PowerShell is used in windows environments for task automation and configuration management.
 Monitoring software is important for IT enviroments for troubleshooting, finding bottlenecks, and ensuring optimal performance.
 Linux is a popular open-source operating system known for its stability, security, and flexibility but comes with a steeper learning curve for new users compared 
 to Windows or MacOS.
